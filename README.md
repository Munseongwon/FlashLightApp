# FlashLightApp

### Why do I select project
-The flashlight widget is always at the top of Android's menu, so I wanted to implement it visually and simply with ui.
-When I turn on this app, I feel like turning on and off the house switch.

### Turn off the light(FlashLight Off)


### Turn on the light(FlashLight On)
